# Global Tech Layoffs Analytics Pipeline
This project provides an end-to-end analytics pipeline for processing, cleaning, and analyzing global tech layoffs data. The pipeline uses SQL for data cleaning and preprocessing, followed by exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify trends, patterns, and insights in the layoffs data. The project aims to provide valuable information about the causes and impacts of layoffs in the tech industry.

## Key steps in the pipeline:

*Data Ingestion*: Collects raw layoffs data from various sources.
*Data Cleaning & Preprocessing*: Cleans and standardizes the data using SQL queries, handling missing values, inconsistencies, and duplicates.
*Exploratory Data Analysis*: Analyzes the cleaned dataset to uncover key trends and insights related to layoffs in global tech companies.
This project helps organizations, HR professionals, and analysts gain a deeper understanding of the factors contributing to layoffs in the tech industry.
